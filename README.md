Gesture-Controlled Mouse Interface using OpenCV

This project implements a Gesture-Controlled Mouse Interface using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI, allowing users to control their computers through hand gestures captured via a webcam. The system detects various hand gestures in real-time and translates them into corresponding mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and custom actions.

Features
Real-time Hand Gesture Detection: Utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks and track movements.
Mouse Cursor Control: Moves the mouse cursor based on the detected hand movements.
Click Actions: Performs left-click, right-click, and double-click actions based on specific gestures.
Scrolling: Supports vertical scrolling using hand gestures.
Custom Gestures: Allows users to define and map custom gestures to perform actions such as taking screenshots, controlling volume, adjusting brightness, and more.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Works on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) with adjustable parameters for different screen resolutions.
Usage
Starting the Application: Run main.py and position your hand in front of the webcam.
Gesture Controls: Perform predefined gestures to control mouse movement, clicking, scrolling, and custom actions.
Keyboard Shortcut: Press 'q' to quit the application.
Advanced Features
Gesture Customization: Define and map custom gestures to specific actions using a configuration file or user interface.
Multi-Gesture Recognition: Detect and respond to multiple gestures simultaneously for complex interactions.
Voice Integration: Optionally integrate voice commands to complement gesture controls for a seamless user experience.
Context-Awareness: Adapt system behavior based on user context, enhancing usability in different environments.
